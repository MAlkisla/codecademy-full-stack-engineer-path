RWRITE EXPRESSIVE TESTS
You can now write tests with Node’s assert library! In this lesson you learned to:

Check for loose (==) equality with assert.equal()
Check for strict (===) equality with assert.strictEqual()
Check the equality of two object’s values with assert.deepEqual()
Make your tests expressive by using different assert methods found in the Node.js documentation.
As you continue to write tests, remember to always evaluate them against the characteristics of a good test: fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive. If you are meeting these six criteria, you are creating high quality test frameworks!
